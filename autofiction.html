    <div class="date">July 22</div>
    <p>When I was nineteen, I came home for the summer greeted by smog-tinted sunsets. Back in the city of angels. I started seeing a boy that I’d known for years. I say boy because that’s what we were at the time, young. Although it’s three years later, and I think I may be younger now.</p>

    <p>One day, he picked me up and took me to the park in our neighborhood. That summer, I spent most afternoons in that park. Smoking weed, kissing boys, and growing up. Just like I had in high school. We walked down to the amphitheater, sitting down on the blue bleachers. I don’t remember what we were talking about, but those are the best kinds of conversations, especially at nineteen when you don’t realize that you’ll remember them forever. I remember him asking why I always wore black, everyone always asked. I told him what I always said - it just sort of happened, and then I liked the way that it made me feel like I was disappearing. He didn’t laugh like I thought he would, he listened. Watching me, in my white dress that was too short. But I was nineteen, and didn’t care. He told me that wearing white is protective.</p>

    <p>It was unbearably hot out that day. I was sweating just enough that I could feel my skin sticking to his jeans. I told him that I didn’t understand how wearing white could protect me, it didn’t have the same effect as wearing black seemed to. When I wear white, I’m always afraid that I’ll stain it with blood or tears or burn holes or desire. But, I think he might be right. That it’s protecting me by letting me see the chaos before it leaks out onto my skin.</p>

    <p>I only saw him once more that summer. He disappeared back into the city as the angels often do in LA. Now, I’m twenty too, and I’ve worn white all summer. I don’t know what I need protecting from. Or if I even want to be protected from the chaos anymore. And I don’t know why, but that memory, our skin sticking just enough that we didn’t move, and that conversation that felt like something happening, has always remained. I guess something must have seeped through to my skin.</p>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">San Francisco 19</div>
    <p>The summer after our first year of college, we drove up to San Francisco for the weekend to visit a friend. We drove there in her Chevy Impala, smoking weed with the windows down. On Saturday, the three of us drove down to Santa Cruz. The cliffs looked dangerous, yet nostalgic. They jumped. I didn’t. I don’t like heights, they make me feel like I’m flying too close to the sun. It’s the first time I’ve been in the ocean all summer.</p>

    <p>At night, we met my cousin and his girlfriend at a club. We ran into his high school friends who did **** out of my acrylic nails. Sunday night, it was just the three of us again. We went back out to a club called the Makeout Room. With no one telling us that it would be better if we were sleeping or staying in. A stranger asked me to dance. All I remember is he was wearing a Bass Pro Shop Hat. And when he asked to kiss me, I said, just once. I found my friends, watching me, and said that we should probably leave. Abandon the night now that I’ve lived up to expectations. The stranger came back up to me and asked for my number, and I lied, saying that I had to leave. No time to give you my number.</p>

    <p>I can’t remember if we left early or late, but it didn’t matter. It just depends who you ask. He got the car to drop us off at the beach. We watched as he ran in, waiting in the sand, my throat sore from laughing or yelling. I can tell I’m starting to lose my voice. I’m wine drunk and exhausted, smoking weed on his stairs before bed. I’ve never been so in love with summer as I was at that moment.</p>

    <p>The weekend ended, and Monday came with silence and daydreams. She drove, I stared out the window. Still hungover and a little stoned. Somewhere between Bakersfield and reality, she tells me to check my phone. It was a message from the boy that I was seeing last summer. He wants to see me. He’s in Europe, but when he’s back. I know it’s a bad idea, but he’s far away. And I’m already daydreaming about someone else.</p>
