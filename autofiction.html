    <p>I don’t know how we ended up here. I don’t think any of us do, we all hate this club, but it’s where we always end up when we go out in LA. I don’t know why. It sucks. The music is never good and the Silverlake millennials can’t seem to escape us. Sam is calling me, he’s outside because they left their IDs in my car. I push through the crowd, I’m already ready to leave. I feel like I’m suffocating in here and need to catch my breath. The bouncer looks at me, recognizing me from just minutes before. I can feel him watching me as I walk over to Sam and Harry. I don’t know if it’s in my head, but I swear I hear him say, you’re a goddess in a city of angels. 

I don’t know what he means by it, but before I can respond or decide if it’s even true, they’re there asking for the keys to my car. So I leave. 

I’m at a loss for words. I need to get out of here, but even as we walk to the car, it feels like there’s no way out. Los Angeles, or really Silverlake is like that scene in Alice in Wonderland where she can’t get out or keeps falling, maybe I’m remembering it wrong. But I’m stuck. There’s no way out and I keep falling even though I’ve only been inside the actual club for five minutes. We’re sitting at a table, and I need to go to the bathroom, but I already know the line will be too long. I’m thirsty and for a second consider drinking the water someone left on the table before us, but there’s a cigarette in it. 

I remember the first time I smoked a cigarette. He passed it to me in a field. I thought it was weed, so I took it. Too late. I’d broken a promise that I’d made to myself and there was no point going back now. 

I want to go back and tell the bouncer that I’m not a goddess. And that most nights, this isn’t a city of angels, but I can’t. Because even when I hate it and can’t escape the club without driving the 40 minutes home, part of me wants to be here.
