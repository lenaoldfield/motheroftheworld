    <div class="date">July 22</div>
    <p>When I was nineteen, I came home for the summer greeted by smog-tinted sunsets. Back in the city of angels. I started seeing a boy that I’d known for years. I say boy because that’s what we were at the time, young. Although it’s three years later, and I think I may be younger now.</p>

    <p>One day, he picked me up and took me to the park in our neighborhood. That summer, I spent most afternoons in that park. Smoking weed, kissing boys, and growing up. Just like I had in high school. We walked down to the amphitheater, sitting down on the blue bleachers. I don’t remember what we were talking about, but those are the best kinds of conversations, especially at nineteen when you don’t realize that you’ll remember them forever. I remember him asking why I always wore black, everyone always asked. I told him what I always said - it just sort of happened, and then I liked the way that it made me feel like I was disappearing. He didn’t laugh like I thought he would, he listened. Watching me, in my white dress that was too short. But I was nineteen, and didn’t care. He told me that wearing white is protective.</p>

    <p>It was unbearably hot out that day. I was sweating just enough that I could feel my skin sticking to his jeans. I told him that I didn’t understand how wearing white could protect me, it didn’t have the same effect as wearing black seemed to. When I wear white, I’m always afraid that I’ll stain it with blood or tears or burn holes or desire. But, I think he might be right. That it’s protecting me by letting me see the chaos before it leaks out onto my skin.</p>

    <p>I only saw him once more that summer. He disappeared back into the city as the angels often do in LA. Now, I’m twenty two, and I’ve worn white all summer. I don’t know what I need protecting from. Or if I even want to be protected from the chaos anymore. And I don’t know why, but that memory, our skin sticking just enough that we didn’t move, and that conversation that felt like something happening, has always remained. I guess something must have seeped through to my skin.</p>

    <div class="date">San Francisco 19</div>
    <p>The summer after our first year of college, we drove up to San Francisco for the weekend to visit a friend. We drove there in her Chevy Impala, smoking weed with the windows down. On Saturday, the three of us drove down to Santa Cruz. The cliffs looked dangerous, yet nostalgic. They jumped. I didn’t. I don’t like heights, they make me feel like I’m flying too close to the sun. It’s the first time I’ve been in the ocean all summer.</p>

    <p>At night, we met my cousin and his girlfriend at a club. We ran into his high school friends who did **** out of my acrylic nails. Sunday night, it was just the three of us again. We went back out to a club called the Makeout Room. With no one telling us that it would be better if we were sleeping or staying in. A stranger asked me to dance. All I remember is he was wearing a Bass Pro Shop Hat. And when he asked to kiss me, I said, just once. I found my friends, watching me, and said that we should probably leave. Abandon the night now that I’ve lived up to expectations. The stranger came back up to me and asked for my number, and I lied, saying that I had to leave. No time to give you my number.</p>

    <p>I can’t remember if we left early or late, but it didn’t matter. It just depends who you ask. He got the car to drop us off at the beach. We watched as he ran in, waiting in the sand, my throat sore from laughing or yelling. I can tell I’m starting to lose my voice. I’m wine drunk and exhausted, smoking weed on his stairs before bed. I’ve never been so in love with summer as I was at that moment.</p>

    <p>The weekend ended, and Monday came with silence and daydreams. She drove, I stared out the window. Still hungover and a little stoned. Somewhere between Bakersfield and reality, she tells me to check my phone. It was a message from the boy that I was seeing last summer. He wants to see me. He’s in Europe, but when he’s back. I know it’s a bad idea, but he’s far away. And I’m already daydreaming about someone else.</p>

  <div class="date">Spring Break Miami 23</div>
   <p>I got this sunburn in Miami on spring break two years ago. The kind of burn that made my eyes bloodshot and you could see where I’d forgotten to put sunscreen. Like I thought part of me was invincible. Four of us, sunburnt and passive aggressive, caring more about what we did then how we felt.</p>
  
   <p>Every night, we had dinner with her grandparents. They had an apartment on the beach. Making us less tourist than we were. Which is what we wanted, to seem like we belonged there. In all the glamour.</p> 
  
   <p>The beaches in Miami are different than in LA. Warm water and skyscrapers in view. We bought bikinis and mini shorts with suggestive writing across the back. It felt necessary. Like we were living up to expectations.</p> 
  
   <p>We went to South Beach, looking for a place to buy weed. It was an endless pursuit. Until the third smoke shop had it behind the counter. I don’t understand why it’s always such a struggle to buy weed in a new city. Just another reminder that we’re not from here. That we’re out of place.</p>
  
   <p>On the last night, we went out. I was exhausted. The exhaustion that comes from soaking under the sun. With girls that are growing tired of each other. The shower made my skin sting. The neckline of my dress showed the burn across my chest. I lay down in bed. My dress read power, fame, greed, money, and drama across the front, which felt right. In the moment.</p> 
  
   <p>The girls went out to smoke. They came back fighting. I don’t remember how the fight ended because it didn’t. But somehow, we made it into a car on the way to the club.</p> 
 
   <p>They say girl’s trips in Miami are cursed. I think they might be right. But it could just be us. Or part of it.</p> 
  
   <p>The promoter met us at the door. I don’t know how she knows him, but it doesn’t matter. He takes us to his table, giving us drinks. Something that sparkled. We held hands through the crowd, pretending like we were still happy to be there with each other.</p>  
  
   <p>Then I lost the night. Or it lost me. In the dancing and waiting in line for the bathroom. Her shoe broke.</p>  
  
   <p>They’re drunk, it’s hot, and I can’t tell if I’m sticky from sweat or the Miami air. Some guy is trying to convince them to come back to his hotel with him. One of the girls bites his neck. I keep checking my phone to see if the car is close.</p> 
  
   <p>The next morning, we’re all hungover and in pain. The fight from last night has resurfaced. The silence feels worse than my head. I don’t even know if I was actually hungover or just done with it all. We pack up, not saying much of anything to anyone.</p> 
  
   <p>We spent the rest of the day by the pool. Pretending like we were still enjoying the Miami heat. I’m trying to apologize. I know that even though I didn’t start it, it’s my fault.</p>  
  
   <p>We wanted spring break with the luxury and seduction and disaster. And yeah, we got it. But now we have to leave.Wondering if maybe it doesn't have to last. And maybe we don't want it to.</p>
