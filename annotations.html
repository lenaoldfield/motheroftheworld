    <div class="essay-title">“No one likes to be confronted with a bunch of disparate details that God only knows what they mean.” - Eve Babitz, <em>Fast Days, Slow Company</em></div>
    <div class="essay-date">September 2025</div>
    <p><strong>I:</strong> Lately, I feel as though everything is falling into alignment. I even hate to admit it. It’s like I’ve been back in LA for three months and can’t avoid the inevitable spirituality that comes with this city. Like for the first time in a while, the sequencing is in order.</p>
    <p><strong>II:</strong> We’re talking about how he was listening to someone talk about how he is energetically spiritual. How the things that he encounters are informing him. As if the things he needs just show up. It’s romantic. He finds them when he needs them. Or, really, they somehow find him.</p>
    <p><strong>III:</strong> I found Eve Babitz when I needed her. I’d spent three weeks, editing the same writing over and over again. Starting to fear that it would never find a conclusion. She was the key to all of it. The final round of editing, so that I could complete the draft. At least in this form of it. She wrote about Los Angeles and love in a way that I wanted to. Without a standard sequence. Reminding me that it didn’t have to be so straightforward. For nothing here occurs out of consequence. While her LA was wild and glamorous, mine is sober and softer. Post-party. But, we’re both caught up in love for this place and people in a way that feels synchronous. Mine is liminal. Longing, for it all. To be eternal. <br><br>As if, once I write it down, it’ll last.</p>
    <p><strong>IV:</strong> It feels like the success of it all is imminent. I can smell what Babitz describes as the smell of rancid gardenias. While this city promises success, it is one that can’t be kept.</p>
    <p><strong>V:</strong> I met a girl the other day. She told me that growing up, she had wished for a different name. My name. I told her that before I was born, my parents considered naming me Mia. Like her. It felt like it meant something. Between us. Maybe it did.</p>
    <p><strong>VI:</strong> I’m confronted with my life, telling the same story over and over again. Trying to find meaning in it. But it isn’t present in the sequence. It’s held in the place. In the desire for the eternal. And in the brutally self aware. It was never about the sequence, but the possibility of making it true. Even when I know better.</p>
