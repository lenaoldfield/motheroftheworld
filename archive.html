    <div class="date">July 19</div>
    <p>I forgot what day it was. I was going through my old journals, looking for a letter that I wrote to an ex. I found it a couple months ago, when my friends and I were reading our journals out loud to each other, which was desperately embarrassing. Today, it felt more pressing than ever to remember what I’d said. That’s when I realized what day it was. July 19th. I don’t know what it is about this day, maybe it’s the way that the city feels slightly off, but somehow they all come back to me. Not literally. Just in the ending and beginning of three relationships, returning, all at once. I’ve been broken up with on July 19th. And I told another boy that I loved him a few years later on the same day. And **** ***** ** on July 19th.</p>
    <p>And now, again. I just got a text from an ex that I’d been waiting to hear back from. I saw him later that night. He gave me the answer that I was looking for or at least part of it. It wasn’t even that I’d been waiting for the message. Waiting usually requires some sort of anticipation. It was just quiet until it wasn’t. I don’t know what it is about this day. It holds no significance. And typically, I don’t even remember what day it is or what has happened in the past, but today I did. Today it was more apparent. I don’t believe in coincidences as much as I used to.</p>

    <p>We’re on the phone, but I can’t focus. I miss when we’d stay up all night, believing we were immortal. My ribs hurt. I can’t hear what she’s saying, and it feels impossible to speak. There’s a pain in my chest. She says it must be anxiety, but it’s not. I don’t think it is. This is a pain. And I’m afraid now that it may be my lung collapsing. What does that even feel like? How would I know if it was.</p>

    <p>I have conversations with you in my head. All day long. It’s starting to drive me insane. I can’t tell the difference between what’s typical of daydreaming and what is too much. I’m living in a state of disillusionment. I feel like I’m in the allegory of the cave, and I don’t know if I’m chained to the walls watching the shadows or discovering that there’s something beyond the reflections. I ask you how you are or if you loved me back then.</p>
    <p>I don’t think that the answers even really matter. I don’t really care to find out if the shadows aren’t real. Or if I’ve already discovered the world outside the cave. I’m starting to think that the distinction between the shadow and the object aren’t so apparent. Or important. It’s probably the reason why I have conversations in my head because at some point we’re all just trying to show each other what we believe to be real. To be the truth. And I can’t control if you believe me or not. I haven’t talked to you in years, and what would the difference be if you were answering the questions that I’m asking you rather than me answering them for myself. Sometimes I can’t tell my dreams from my days. I don’t know if it matters. Or if it’s just an issue that is too far gone to fix. Sometimes I think I just know too much. Could just be going insane.</p>

    <div class="date">July 31</div>
    <p>I can’t believe it’s already the end of July. It’s hot by the pool, and I’m thinking about our conversation last night. I told him that he was in my dream. He was comforting me, but I can’t remember why. I keep being comforted in my dreams, but wake up not remembering what was wrong. What did I need to be comforted about?</p>
    <p>It’s 1 AM and they want beer. I’ll drive given sainthood by sobriety. But everyone wants to come. I guess we all want something to do or somewhere to go. Hoping that we’ll find something out there beyond the corner store. Something that we can deem better than the night, the silence, or each other.</p>

    <div class="date">August 1</div>
    <p>I’m at a party that I don’t want to be at. I don’t know what my problem is. Maybe it’s being 22 in a city that isn’t really a city at all. But I can never figure out whether I hate being alone or being at a party more. Right now, I’m stuck in limbo. Walking up and down the stairs. They’re doing ketamine in the bathroom. And I want to leave. I’m sitting at the car while he rolls a joint. We’ve lost our friends in the party. I’m staring out at the lights of the city. From here, they all seem to merge into one. I laugh at something he says, I can’t remember what. All I can think about is how I can’t leave Los Angeles. Even if I don’t want to be here right now.</p>

    <div class="date">August 6</div>
    <p>I’m in therapy, talking about nothing in particular. My therapist says that some of us want to be grounded and some of us want to have wings, to feel like we can fly. I think I want to be grounded so that I can feel safe enough to fly. Apparently, this is associated with deep rooted control issues. It makes sense. I’m 22 and sober. And I was never really addicted to anything other than control. A desire to know what happens next.</p>
    <p>My sister and I are looking at plane tickets to New York. I tell her that I need more time to think about it. I say it’s because of the cost and not knowing what I’ll do there, but the truth is, I don’t want to leave. When I wake up, I check the flight, it’s sold out. Maybe it’s a sign. I don’t think it is though. It says more about me than the universe. My sister is the kind of person who wants to feel like she can fly. I am not.</p>

    <div class="date">August 7</div>
    <p>I took a vow of silence today. I’ve been talking more than usual, and I don’t know why. I don’t really like talking or having people hear what I’m saying. So, I’ve taken a vow of silence. I don’t plan on breaking it until a guy approaches me on the beach. He compliments me and asks for my number. I respond quickly, no, sorry. Immediately, I feel bad that I don’t say more. Too sharp, too short. I don’t know if I feel bad for him or myself. My vow of silence has been broken.</p>
    <p>I just got out of the water, and Olivia is calling me. She’s in LA now and she misses me. I miss her. We’re talking about how anytime we come back to LA, we feel like transplants. Like we’re realizing again that we could live here. That’s the thing about this place, you don’t realize how much you love it until you leave and come back. Almost like the city is driving you out then waiting for you to return.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="date">August 10</div>
    <p>It’s past midnight, and we’re outside in the alley. They’re smoking, and I feel like I may as well be stoned too. Dancing. We keep setting the neighbor’s motion sensor lights off. His arm is around me as we walk down to the lookout. Running to the beach. He’s leaving tomorrow and then she’ll be leaving too. And I’m just here now. Everything is going to keep coming, and I can’t stop it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">August 21</div>
    <p>There’s a heat wave in Los Angeles. I’m driving through the Malibu Canyon, and I’m worried my car is going to break down. I text Olivia that I’m on my way.</p>
    <p>I can’t believe it’s still August. This summer feels endless. Probably because I’m not going back. I have nothing to count down to. I’m just here. Until I’m not. I like it here. I wonder if it’ll change when she leaves. I’ve always hated being left alone. Being alone in general. It used to drive me insane. Right now, I don’t mind it so much.</p>
    <p>Olivia runs out. She’s barefoot and laughing, spinning in circles. I’ve never seen her in LA before, but this is the epitome of everything I wanted when I was seventeen. The part of LA where everyone feels lighter, almost like they’re light themselves. This is the LA that I wished to grow up in. The one that I prayed for entry into.</p>
    <p>I drive home on the PCH. The sun is setting behind me. And I want to go back. I want to stay in that world forever.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">August 25</div>
    <p>I’m meeting an ex for coffee today. I don’t even know if I should say that we’re exes. We never officially dated, but that’s how things go with me. For him, for us, it feels like the only term that fits - in short. We saw each other almost everyday for three weeks. Even though the end was inevitable. I went off to college and he moved to Europe. I suppose that means we both made poor decisions.</p>
    <p>I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. But then he came back. It’s been four years. The last time that I saw him was the night we said goodbye. We’ve only talked once since then, a few summers ago. When, somehow things between us felt closer and also far apart.</p>
    <p>We’ve gotten older. Been to different cities, become different versions of ourselves, and it’s apparent. But there’s something between us, and I can tell that he cares about me. It’s nice. I wasn’t even sure of his feelings back then. We’ve both moved on, but it’s nice to know that it was real even if I didn’t always know it.</p>
    <p>I’ve always hated giving up past relationships. It isn’t that I want them back. I don’t. I just don’t want them to leave me completely.</p>
    <p>There are three things that happen when you see an ex. The obvious one is sex. The most common one is that one of us still has feelings while the other does not. The last is my favorite. And it rarely happens. It’s that both of us are ok with what we were to each other, and what we are now even if it’s different than before. Sometimes, the love from the past is even more apparent than it was at the time, enough that we can be there and leave again.</p>

    <div class="date">August 27</div>
    <p>Los Angeles makes me more spiritual than I want to be. It’s inescapable. Almost like everyone here knows something that others don’t.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">August 28</div>
    <p>I’m realizing that I know less at 22 than I thought I did at nineteen. Or maybe, I’m just more aware of what I do and don’t know. That summer, I thought I’d figured out everything that was coming, but I hadn’t. I thought that I wasn’t ready for you, but now I think it’s you that wasn’t ready for me.</p>
    <p>It’s late, I should go. I don’t think I’ll ever have you, not completely. I can keep thinking about it, or I can just let it keep coming. I’ve been trying to write away from LA because I’m planning to move. Like if I avoid it for long enough, I can sneak away without the city noticing. It’s masochistic that I’m here now. Because I never want to leave.</p>
    <p>It’s embarrassing to love LA. But, for me, it’s inevitable. It’s like the city becomes a part of you before you even have the chance to stop it. And by the time you realize it, you’re already halfway gone.</p>

   <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">August 29</div>
    <p>I’m going to a party by myself tonight. I’m following the moon through downtown Los Angeles, losing sight of it when I pass the city. I’ve always found downtown intriguing, in the sense that it’s the only part of LA with buildings that could even be considered skyscrapers. Watching it pass, it feels untouched. As if, LA needed it to be considered a city. I’ve lost the moon for good, but it doesn’t matter. It’s what's beyond that I’m searching for, the eternity that exists here. LA is a paradox. There’s fear and freedom. I can feel it vividly tonight. The city seems to call out, taunting me. As if the moment I grasp a hold of it, it’ll let me go.</p> 
    <p>If someone were to look over at me, they’d probably assume that I was bored or trying too hard, but the truth is, I’m comfortable here. At least for a while. I stay, wondering what the city has to offer me tonight. I get up to dance. It’s just me and the dj who is making out with a girl, who I think may be his girlfriend. Until I hear another girl whisper about how she used to have lots of sex with him, but then he showed up here with her instead. That’s the thing about LA, everyone seems to be far apart from each other until they’re not. I can feel the discomfort in my body, urging itself to let go. Be free.</p>  
    <p>There’s a curtain at the back of the room, and I watch as people keep disappearing behind it. I wonder what the world is like behind that curtain. She’s building a universe around herself. One that I dream of being a part of. I want to tell her to take me with her when she goes. I can smell the ketamine in the air, and even in my sobriety, I am captivated. It’s true - my LA is soft and sober, but I can’t help, but revel in the beauty of it all. I’ve found a place to lay in my escapism. The girls around me seem to be made of light. They’re the kind of girls that you can’t decide if you’d rather be or be with. As if they never chose whether to be real or be seen.</p> 
    <p>Even in the softness of the night, losing the moon, it feels like this is where I should be. And if I stay long enough rather than linger, I may enter the world beyond and encounter more of their light.</p>

    <div class="date">September 1</div>
    <p>If one more person tries to tell me it’s fall, I’ll scream. People say that summer is perpetual, eternal in LA. It’s not completely true. If you’re from here - really from here, you know that weather isn’t completely evasive. It just doesn’t have the same effect that weather anywhere else does. It waits for you to forget it exists, and then it appears. Here, it’s earthquakes and Santa Anas and prayer for rain. Right now, I wish what they said was true. I wish this summer was endless.</p> 
    <p>It’s hot out, today. Unbearably so. I can’t stand it. So I watch it from the window of my bedroom. The mountains are turning orange, growing more red as the sun sets. The light reflecting back. They used to be purple. But now, the bare surface of them lets the color shift at sunset. The sky behind them is light blue even though it’s 7PM. So beautiful it feels almost cruel. It hasn’t been clear like this in a long time. I swear the smog gets thicker in the summer. It’s hot, but my tan lines are fading away with my freedom. Almost as if my fear is coming true. And summer isn’t as endless as I wish for.</p> 
    <p>My sister and I are going out. We aren’t going anywhere, just out. We drive around with the windows down and the AC on. It’s a contradiction that only makes sense in LA. There’s something about letting the hot air in that reminds me of summer. I haven’t driven with the windows down since before she left. I picked her up from LAX the other night. I don’t mind the drive anymore. I prefer it. There’s something so beautifully LA about the freeway. About getting lost in the roads, in the traffic, especially at night. Stuck in traffic with your own private prayers surrounded by angels caught in their own. There’s freedom in knowing it’ll take me an hour to get anywhere. Traffic wasn’t bad that night. But I still had time to think. To feel. To remember things that I never thought I would.</p> 

   <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">September 5</div>
    <p>I haven’t left my bed in days. Three at least. I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t have anything to write about. Or think about.</p> 
    <p>I could talk about my dreams, but I barely remember them. I wish I wouldn’t. Some things are best forgotten.</p> 
    <p>My mother says I’m too pretty to stay inside all day. And too smart to not be doing something. Like I’m not living up to my potential. I don’t think I expect much of myself. I think it’s all fucked up.</p>
    <p>But it’s still summer for me. It might always be, from now on.</p> 
    <p>I wrote letters to my friends in New York. My letters always seem to get lost. Maybe I’ll try to send them this time. Maybe.</p>
    <p>I don’t even know where to send them. Everyone is moving.</p> 
    <p>Today, I feel like I could drive to them. If I wanted to. But living in New York? The city I mean, it seems impossible. I know myself well enough to know that everything in that city is too close, too fast, too loud for me. And I like it here.</p>

 <div class="entry">
   <div class="date">September 7</div>
   <p>We’re staying the night at the Ritz Carlton hotel. Everything is too clean, too cold. I’m sure they think I’m trashy. And not in a seductive way. In a way that makes even the men uncomfortable. I want to disappear. My card doesn’t go through. Now they really know that I shouldn’t be here.</p>
   <p>I feel like I may as well be a hooker. I’m dressed better than any of them. In their khaki shorts and polo shirts. It doesn’t matter. My dress is too short. Too tight.</p> 
   <p>We check in. No one stops us. We’re laughing about how we must look. Too young. Too beautiful.</p> 
   <p>By the pool. We get drinks. It feels rich. But also like we don’t fit. It’s fine. I hope I always feel a little out of place here. I wouldn’t want to lose myself. Or the attention.</p> 
   <p>I order a nonalcoholic drink. The waitress looks at me. Either thinking that I’m too young to be there. Or too young to have gone sober. In a way, I guess I am. But it’s not what they think. Not completely. There are things that I’ve quit that no one knows about.</p> 
   <p>We dance around the hotel room that is too big for us. It’s beautiful because it isn’t ours. Because of how much we don’t belong. Like we broke in and stayed too long.</p> 

 <div class="entry">
   <div class="date">September 8</div>  
   <p>It’s past midnight. I haven’t seen him in awhile. He’s been working. We’re going over later. It’s dark. The moon was full last night. We couldn’t reach it. We drove around trying to find a place where it was lower. Closer to us.</p>
   <p>We’re sitting in the dark. I can’t find the lights. She’s in the pool, swimming. He’s rolling a joint. I don’t know much about him for someone I’ve known my whole life. We’re worried about him. But, it’s out of our control.</p>
   <p>I tell them about the boy who took me to an abandoned castle. We met again this year. We were sitting on a couch, talking like we knew each other well. Everything he says feels louder. Intense. Like a manifesto.</p>
   <p>We’re driving past the abandoned building. He says that he tried to get in once, but the fence was too high. Like that means something. It does to me.</p>
   <p>I have a headache. We’re in the garage. I close my eyes. I wake up to his face. Asking me what I think. I don’t know what I think.</p>
   <p>She drives home. She’s been telling me about her dreams lately. Her to-do list titled, to mitigate stress dreams.</p>
   <p>When I wake up, she’s still asleep beside me. I hope these dreams are just dreams. Although neither of us believes that.</p>

 <div class="entry">
   <div class="date">September 15</div>  
   <p>The four of us are talking about how nothing matters. Or something philosophical. I can’t really remember. Our conversations always seem to switch between nonsense and us trying to make sense of things. Especially when it’s late and someone is leaving.</p>
   <p>He goes out back. Yells for us, come look at this flower. It’s a queen of the night. They only bloom for one night. It opens at dusk and by dawn, it dies. Of course it does. We’re standing around as if it is holy. Don’t get me started on being perceived. We’re talking about how we see each other. How other people see us. I didn’t realize that she saw me like that. He’s seen three bloom. I’ve only seen one. Tonight.</p>
   <p>I’m driving her up to college. It’s a five hour drive. And I’ve agreed to drive the whole way. </p>
   <p>It’s only been an hour and I regret it. Everything hurts. I take off my flats. This drive is the worst. It’s ugly. The smog is still heavy even though we’re past the city. And I hate the grapevine. I don’t know why. I guess it’s the heat and the flat lands. The lack of anything to look at.</p>
   <p>We’re almost there. We get onto the highway at half moon bay. The air is cool. The first cool air in a while.The fog seems to be falling from the sky. Like it’s dropping to the earth. As if it’s paying attention to us. She tells me it’s always at transitions that the fog shows up. That it’s meaningful. I don’t know what she meant. But, it’s a fitting symbol.</p>

 <div class="entry">
   <div class="date">September 28</div>
   <p>I haven’t been writing even though I should be. It’s not because there isn’t anything to say. Most days I feel like I’m caught in the middle of a dream. The meanings aren’t clear even when I reach for it. I lose it.  And I just can’t figure out what any of it means or how to even begin to write about it. But it’s dreams like this that I know I need to write about. To find out what I’m thinking.I feel like I haven’t left my room in days. My sense of time feels insignificant.  I don’t really know what to do with myself.</p>
   <p>I’m texting Maria. She’s at Soho House. In Mexico. With * *** *** ***** **** ** *** **********. She sends a photo of the pool. Clear blue water. The light perfectly mocking me. I wish I was there right now.</p>
   <p>I take a shower at midnight. Just to feel something.</p>
   <p>We were driving somewhere I can’t remember, when she asked what our biggest regrets were. I was the only one who answered.</p>
   <p>I leave in two weeks. I need to figure out how to pack my life up into a carry on bag. The list of things just keeps getting longer. And, I don’t know what I’m holding onto.</p>
   <p>None of it feels real. All of it feels urgent.</p>

 <div class="entry">
   <div class="date">October 5</div>
   <p>Right now, everything is just liminal. And lonely.</p>
   <p>I got a text the other day, “you’re so fascinating and random.” It’s a good way to put it. For a stranger.</p>
   <p>We’re supposed to meet tomorrow. I already know I’m going to cancel. I’m too stressed. But I guess that’s just how I live. Most of the time. I never thought I’d be so artificial. Synthetic.</p>
   <p>Lately, everything I write is uninteresting. I only ever talk to the past in my notebooks, in places I return to hoping to find you. Sometimes I just wish our communication wasn’t so distant.</p>
   <p>It isn’t that I love you still. I just live in dreams and fantasies. And unfinished business. I don’t want you. I like writing about the past as if it means something. As if it’s not so far away from me now.</p>
   <p>I feel like I’m not doing enough, which probably means that I’m doing too much. I’m writing in the dark. Clearly, overstimulated.</p>
   <p>My mother asked if I’m depressed. I said no. Maybe I am. Or I just like staring at ceilings. Especially right now. It feels like I can’t keep my eyes open.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, all my dreams will come true. Or, at least something will happen.</p>

 <div class="entry">
   <div class="date">October 12</div>
   <p>48 hours in New York City. I got off the plane after sleeping for the 4 and a half hour flight that they say is 6. Flying is the only time that I break my sobriety. And thank god for medication. Psychiatric assistance is unmatched. I didn’t know how I would feel being back here. I don’t know if I was really avoiding it, but I wasn’t sure when I’d be ready to come back. I wasn’t made for this city like they were. It’s not something I’m upset about. Just a truth. But now I’m here. I almost wish it would last longer. It’s probably best that it doesn’t.</p>
   <p>She drove down from upstate to see me, and thank god. I haven’t been in touch like I thought I was. Missing out on more of her life than I knew. That’s to be expected though. Our lives are all moving in different directions and at the same pace. Catching up isn’t as hard as it used to be.</p>
   <p>We go for drinks at a bar. Everything seems to fall into place when I’m with them. Like we aren’t as far apart. Like it hasn’t been over four months since I saw them. The next bar is only a few blocks away, and we walk in the rain. His umbrella covering me just enough. But I like the rain here. It’s different. Almost like the way the buildings are all pushed in on each other is enough protection. The rain is romantic. It’s not like this in California.</p>
   <p>She gives her bra away for a free shot and they staple it to the wall with all the others. Their beers come in deli cups. And I laugh as they wrap two hands around them to drink. We’re the only people here and I’m happy about it.</p>
   <p>We go for Dim Sum in Chinatown. He’s standing outside smoking a cigarette when we walk up. He picks me up, kissing me on the top of my head. I laugh. I’ve missed him. She brings a bottle of wine and they drink as we eat. Afterwards, we walk through the alleyways, wandering without any real destination. It’s too cold and we were all out late the night before. Some of them were out late the night before that and still seem to be recovering. I wonder if this is what their lives are like here. Night after night. I wish they’d stay longer, but I have to go.</p>
   <p>He gets on the train with us. Laughing about my fears of being underground. I don’t know where I’m going. It’s a freedom that I love about feeling so out of place here. Like I’m a shadow following them through.</p>
   <p>He gets off before us. Pressing his butt to the glass of the subway window as he leaves.</p>
   <p>Only 48 hours. I want more. But, I live by the rule of leaving *** ***** **** ***** ******* ***. And I need sleep.</p>

 <div class="entry">

   <p>We’re leaving Tennessee or Virginia. I’m not sure. The town we’re staying in is right on the border, and I can’t seem to figure out which side we’re on. A man in the grocery store tells her that we’re crazy for moving to New Orleans, why would anyone want to go there? I wonder if it’s a battle of southern cities. Or if he just doesn’t feel the pull like we do.</p>

   <p>We moved here 72 hours ago. They invite us over, telling us that they know the people that we need to meet.</p>
   <p>“You’ll feel like you’re being swallowed, but being swallowed isn’t a bad thing.”</p>
   <p>There are two rules that you need to live by. I’m not sure if they mean in general or here, in New Orleans. The first one is to not believe anything you hear and only half of what you see. I think I do this. The second is to treat everyone the same because you never know who you’re talking to.I’m learning that I have to stop thinking that the people I surround myself with have to be beautiful. Or like me.</p>
   <p>They’re moving back here in a week. Somehow they convince us to come with them to a place called Le Bon.She wants to dance. I’m too sober to think this is a good idea. And too sober to tell them that we won’t come.</p>
   <p>We’re driving over a bridge in a city I don’t know. It’s raining. I hope I can call a car home. The bar is like any other bar.</p>
   <p>I don’t know if people here are trying to scare us to protect us or to see if we belong.</p>

   <p>I woke up this morning and the house was shaking. A thunderstorm outside.I can see flashes of lightning through the curtains. I used to love the sound of thunderstorms at night. Sleeping while the sky ran wild outside. Now, not so much.I don’t know what to do in a tornado.“Go to the basement or lay down on the floor of an interior room, like a bathroom or closet.” I woke back up at 10 and the rain was gone. The sun breaking through the windows.</p> 
   <p>We left for the day without much of a plan. Stuck in traffic.Can’t find parking. We leave.</p> 
   <p>Angel wings are $45. Too expensive.</p>

   <p>I felt out of it all day yesterday. Tried to write about it today, but I could tell it was the wrong decision. My pen stopped working and I took it as a sign.</p> 
   <p>I haven’t been wearing the obsidian necklace. I’m afraid of it. Like all the negative energy that it was absorbing leaked into me.</p>
   <p>This city has an energy. One that I can’t ignore.I’m not embarrassed to admit that I feel it. Not here. Because it seems that everyone else, who has stayed long enough to know it, feels it too.</p>
   <p>It isn’t something that I want to let go of. Already. I can tell that it’s going to change my life. Not for any particular reason. Not because something will happen. But because I will let it.</p>

   <div class="date">November 26</div>
   <p>I know I’m behind. It’s almost like the entire month of November doesn’t exist here. But, it did. That’s the thing about archives, about writing, it’s just one version of what happened. One truth. That is temporary.</p> 
   <p>I don’t know where to start in recounting everything. So much has happened. So quickly time has passed, escaped us. In a few days, we’ll have a month left here. I hate to think about it. I don’t ever want to leave.</p>
   <p>I’ve been trying to keep an analog journal of my days here, alongside this one. Both keep getting forgotten.</p>
   <p>Today, we took the car to the shop. Both side mirrors broken. She said it was bad luck, but I think it cancels out. I at least hope so.</p>
   <p>People have been visiting all month. It’s been busy and exhausting. Falling into a routine. My therapist says that routine is important, at the end of the day, it’s all that we have. It’s what makes us who we are. I guess it’s true.</p>
   <p>I’ve never had or felt freedom like I do, here, when I wake up. Barely knowing or not knowing at all, what my day will look like. When it’s just the two of us, we walk in circles, seeing and thinking about things to talk about.</p>
   <p>He was here the longest. We spent three days at the pool. Writing, talking about where we’ll all be in five years. He says I look good. Like I’ve aged as if it hasn’t been six months since I last saw him. Like I know what I’m doing. I can’t argue. I feel that way about myself. Maybe it’s vain or naive to think that I have everything figured out. I know that I don’t. But, for the most part, I feel like what I’m doing right now, in this moment, is right. I’m not so afraid of the future. Less concerned about it than I’ve ever been. And the past, well, I’m letting it rest there for a while.</p>
   <p>I have so much to say about this city, this life. I don’t want it to be just three months in a dream. It isn’t. Not in the way that I see it. Or think about it.</p>
   <p>We’re in bed, thinking about how neither of us wants to leave. The mirrors are fixed. We might just drive West when it ends. I don’t know. Neither of us does. It doesn’t seem to matter too much. Because right now, we’re here. Half asleep and wide awake in our dreams.</p>

   <p>This website has lost my devotion. But, everything was moving all at once, and I needed time to catch up.</p>
   <p>I’m in Los Angeles again.</p>
   <p>I’m writing, but nothing feels complete. Not for other eyes. And sometimes, not even for my own to return to.</p>
   <p>I’m back. And I love January in Los Angeles. When the mountains feel too close, and the sky is always a dream at 6 pm. I lost my virginity in January.</p>
   <p>She’s here with me. We’re laying in bed, and waking up right as the sun rises. This morning, without words, she told me to go back to sleep. Until we both woke up.</p>
   <p>To me, January has always been the last month of the year. December was lost. In the confrontation of things. In the preparation for what’s to come.</p>
   <p>We sleep with the window open. And I remove words from my writing that I can’t stand.</p>
   <p>I need to return to the routine of just writing for my own memory. Lately, everything is too romantic. Or too digital. And my voice is a sound lost with aging. We can’t hear it at a certain frequency.</p>
   <p>Last night, we went to see him. To say goodbye. Right as I return, he leaves. I’m afraid this is what our lives will be like now. At least for a while.</p>
   <p>The conversations got bigger as the night continued. And then he left.</p>

   <p>I had a dream last night that I can’t remember. All I remember is that all of them were in it. Almost everyone that’s ever meant something to me. I was dancing under a chandelier, watching them watch me, but I kept hitting my head on the chandelier above me.</p>
   <p>I rarely remember my dreams. This is all I have from that night. Dancing into the chandelier. As I do with most things, I looked up the meaning. Dancing is obviously a symbol of freedom. While the chandelier put me in the spotlight. I kept finding their eyes on me, knowing that they were watching me. I didn’t mind it. Embarrassed only by the way I kept knocking into the low hanging light. A subconscious awareness that what I’m doing now is causing me pain.</p>
   <p>I woke up to my fingernails pressing painfully into my palms. Even when I fall asleep, I am confronted with everything at night.</p>
   <p>I’m trying not to edit my writing. Instead, let it exist on the internet.</p>
   <p>I dreamt of suffocation. Waking up in the heat.</p>
   <p>Lately,  I wake up at the first light. Praying that I do what I must.</p>

<div class="entry">
   <div class="date">January 20</div>
   <p>Lately, I’m preoccupied with digital portals. My google search is overrun with my desire to build a portal here. To place myself in a waterfall or digital dream of pixels that you can access.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, we went to Santa Monica. The light was beautiful. And I was reminded of the freedom that I have here. I could be anywhere in LA. There’s so much I could be doing. That’s the thing about a city with this geographic layout. You forget about it when you’re from here. Except for those frequent moments that you’re caught in traffic. Now, I’m here again, and so much of the city- I don’t know. Not like I should.</p>
   <p>Today, we drove up into the mountains. Taking photos at the crest, where all the mountains seem to exist on each other.</p>
   <p>To build a digital portal. Clarify. Does it glow like the light here does? Placing the pixels upon each other.</p>
   <p>I can’t go to the mountains that I used to. Or swim in the waterfall down below. And, I’m getting frustrated with myself. I wish I could pixelate. I wish I could access this city beyond what I know.</p>

   <p>It rained for less than a minute today. Almost as if the sky had hardly any tears to shed. I miss the snow in upstate New York. Even though it was never as beautiful, never lasted as long as I wanted it to. But, I do miss it. Last winter, the river froze over. Broken into a million fractured pieces. We climbed over it, topless, a tiger and a snake, braving the river winds. Letting the sunlight split through the ice. Onto us.</p>
   <p>Today, the sky turned orange. Like the haze of a fire. A light I know too well. From flying too close to the sun.</p>
   <p>She wrote a beautiful entry about one of our nights in the snow. We all stared into the street. Leaving the first steps. As if the silence, an absent presence could consume us. I remember a few days or weeks later, her and I, running through the streets dressed in all white. As living snow angels. Whispering, just loud enough that the wind would carry our voices back down to the river.</p>
   <p>I’ve never known the weather. Not like I did then. Not like I do now. My phone says that there has been no rain in the past 24 hours. I wonder if the two of us were the only ones to hear her cry.</p>
