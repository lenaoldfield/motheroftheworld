    <p>It’s midnight, I’m with Sam and Harry standing outside the garage while everyone else gets drunk and high inside. I tell Harry that I had a dream about him last night. I can’t remember why, but he was comforting me. He says he’s glad that he was there. I don’t know who changed the conversation, it was probably me. I’m talking a lot more than I used to. But, now, we’re talking about how sometimes we can’t tell our dreams from our days. I think I spend most days in the summer, dreaming.</p>
    <p>It’s almost 2 AM and we’ve decided that we need more beer. I offer to drive to the 7/11 and pick it up. Sam and Penina say that they’ll come with me. We’re walking to the car when everyone else shouts for us to wait. It’s only a few minutes away, but I guess everyone is either bored or restless or needs something. It’s somewhere to go. I buy a soda and a donut for my sister. On the way back, I slow down for the dip in the road, remembering the night I went speeding through it. It was dark and we all hit our heads on the ceiling.</p>

    <p>I’m at a party. I don’t want to be here. I’ve spent the last hour walking up and down the stairs. Sam and I are waiting outside the house while everyone else does drugs in the bathroom. We can’t find the people we came with. We’re back at the car, so Sam can roll a joint, and I can catch my breath. I’m waiting for our friends to return, so we can leave, drive off, go somewhere else when I get a phone call.</p>
    <p>I find her down the street, crying behind the cars. I sit with her on the curb until her uber arrives. She keeps apologizing for crying. I don’t say what I’m thinking, which is that someone always has to cry at the party. Instead, I tell her it’s fine. I don’t tell her that this is the only part of the night that I’ve enjoyed. Sitting on the curb, escaping the people I don’t know and don’t want to get to know.</p>
    <p>I don’t know why I always feel upset about not going out more, when truthfully, I never like it when I do. Especially not in LA. She leaves, and I find my friends and ask if we should leave. It’s less of a question and more of a statement. We get in the car and drive back home. I look out the window, this is my favorite freeway in Los Angeles, especially at night. Along the hillside, I can see all the lights of the nearby neighborhoods merging into one. It’s 2 AM when I get home. I’m sunburnt and too tired to take my makeup off. My stomach hurts. I can’t deny my love for Los Angeles. My daydreams are made up of this city. Even when I spend my nights alone or at parties and clubs that I want to leave upon arrival. I can’t help but love it.</p>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">August 6</div>
    <p>I’m in therapy, talking about nothing in particular. My therapist says that some of us want to be grounded and some of us want to have wings, to feel like we can fly. I think I want to be grounded so that I can feel safe enough to fly. Apparently, fear of flying is associated with deep rooted control issues. It makes sense. I’m 22 and sober. And I was never really addicted to anything other than control.</p>
    <p>My sister and I are looking at plane tickets to New York. I tell her that I need more time to think about it. I say it’s because of the cost and not knowing what I’ll do there, but the truth is, I don’t want to leave. When I wake up, I check the flight, it’s sold out. Maybe it’s a sign. I don’t think it is though. It says more about me than the universe. My sister is the kind of person who wants to feel like she can fly. I am not.</p>
